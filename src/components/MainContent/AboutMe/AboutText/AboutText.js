      The rest of my website is filled with the typical boring career stuff, so I saved this page to talk about the real me.
      I love sharing what I have and using my abilities to help those in need, whether they're people or animals.
      When I'm not doing that, you can find me traveling, playing drums in a band, whipping up tasty beverages, and walking around with my headphones on.
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm always eager to learn new things and I don't give up easily.
      I'm fluent in Korean, English, and Chinese so you can trust me to communicate effectively in any situation.
      I thrive in fast-paced environments and love working with all kinds of people in different locations.
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm a big believer in creativity and I'm always on the lookout for innovative solutions to bring to the market.
      Please feel free to connect with me for any interesting opportunities!
